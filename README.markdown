# outpost-web

This is a simple Sinatra application demonstrating how you can use the
[outpost gem](http://www.github.com/vinibaggio/outpost) to help you monitor
your app(s), check it for more information.

You can see it running at [outpost-web.vinibaggio.net](http://outpost-web.vinibaggio.net) (soon)!

It currently monitors:

* Call 4 paperz (at [call4paperz.com](http://www.call4paperz.com))
* Agendatech (at [agendatech.com.br](http://www.agendatech.com.br))

Fork it away! This might be a good start for your own project's dashboard.
